Scribus slide deck
==================
This folder contains scribus documents which are slide deck templates. Currently, there's only one: deck.sla.

deck.sla
--------
Contains canvas which is 216mm high by 288mm wide; this yields a 4:3 aspect ratio. The 4:3 aspect ratio is common for projectors, including VGA (640 x 480), SVGA (800 x 600), and XGA (1024 x 768). The height of the canvas is equal to 8.5 inches and the width is equal to 11.34 inches. These dimensions are close to the standard letter paper size.
